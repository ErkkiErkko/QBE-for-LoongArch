- Known Issues about QBE for LoongArch

1. The current implementation of converting between floating point numbers and unsigned integers would get wrong result when the number is in $[2^{31}, 2^{32} - 1]$. (Causing the test case `fpcnv.ssa` failed.)

2. The current implementation of instruction `break` is wrong.

3. I have replaced all `.bss` with `.data`, without investigating its potential effects. (This change was initially for passing the test case `_slow.qbe`.)
